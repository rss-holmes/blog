# First Class objects

A first class object is an entity that can be dynamically created, destroyed, passed to a function,

returned as a value, and have all the rights as other variables in the programming language have.

- being expressible as an anonymous literal value

- being storable in variables

- being storable in data structures

- having an intrinsic identity (independent of any given name)

- being comparable for equality with other entities

- being passable as a parameter to a procedure/function

- being returnable as the result of a procedure/function

- being constructible at runtime

- being printable

- being readable

- being transmissible among distributed processes

- being storable outside running processes

in contrast functions are not first class objects in many languages -

In C++

- Functions themselves are not first class objects.You can override the '()' operator making it possible to have an object function, which is first class.

- Function pointers are first class

- Classes are not first class objects but instances of those classes are
